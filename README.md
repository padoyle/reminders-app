# Reminders-tracking App
This is a minimal reminder-tracking app built in Kotlin for Android.  My goal with this project was to learn how Kotlin works and learn about some of the Kotlin frameworks built for Android.

## Features
### Reminders
 - List of reminders with description and due date (backed by an internal SQLite Database).
 - Add, edit, or delete existing reminders.
 - View list of completed reminders and delete or mark incomplete.

### Notifications
 - Optional scheduled daily notification that warns about upcoming or overdue reminders.
 - Adjustable notification settings (only notify for one day in advance, notify at specified time, etc.)
